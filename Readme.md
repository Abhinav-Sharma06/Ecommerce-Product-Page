**Project Name: Ecommerce Product Page**

Welcome to our Ecommerce Product Page project! This web application is designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers features for adding items to a cart, removing items, and managing the shopping cart.

**Key Features:**
Product Catalog: Browse through a diverse range of products displayed on the product page. Each product is accompanied by an image, description, and price for easy identification and selection.

Add to Cart: With just a click of a button, users can add their desired items to the shopping cart. The quantity and total price are dynamically updated to reflect the changes.

Remove Items: Users have the flexibility to remove items from the shopping cart if they change their minds or wish to make adjustments. The cart automatically recalculates the total price and updates the display accordingly.
